# OLIST Market Data Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This repository contains the code and analysis for an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project conducted on OLIST's market data. The goal of this project was to gain insights into the dataset and propose potential solutions to increase profit for OLIST.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is provided by OLIST and contains information about customer orders, products, sellers, and reviews. The data is stored in multiple CSV files.

## Analysis
### Exploratory Data Analysis
The EDA process involved the following steps:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Descriptive statistics and summary metrics
- Identifying key trends, patterns, and anomalies

### Potential Solutions
Based on the EDA results, several potential solutions were identified to increase profit for OLIST:
1. **Remove Underperforming Sellers**: Some sellers are having a negative impact in terms of costs and negative reviews. Removing them can increase future profit. 

2. **Restrict Sign Ups of New Sellers**: Some states, potentially due to proximity to most buyers, and thus delivery time, can lead to problems. Restricting signup in these states can increase efficiency and reputation.
